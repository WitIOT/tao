/* DOCUMENT nlist = bi_dir(tracker, mesh, rays, slimits, c, s)

     Perform hexX_track and track_reduce on a ray that enters
     the problem at the given point on the ray.  This requires
     tracking the ray in both directions from the given point,
     hence this function name indicating bi-directional tracking.
     This is unnecessary when the entry point search was over
     the problem boundary, or when the SLIMITS for the rays
     always lie in one direction relative to the starting point.

     TRACKER is the function used to track the rays, normally
       one of hex5_track, hex_24f_track, or hex24b_track.
     MESH is the problem mesh returned by hex_mesh or hydra_mesh;
       it should be generated using the entry option that finds
       the cell containing the given point on the ray.
     RAYS is the 3-by-nrays-by-2 array of rays, as for hex5_track
     SLIMITS is nil or the ray tracking limits as for track_reduce
     C, S, together with NLIST are the output arrays, as for
       track_reduce

/* DOCUMENT c_adjust, c, mesh
         or c_adjust, c, mesh, 1

     adjust the cell number array C returned by track_reduce to
     allow for a different layout of cell arrays than the one assumed
     by the tracking routines.  Two HOW values are currently
     supported: 0 (or nil) if the cell arrays are the same shape as
     the nodal arrays, but the non-existent cell is at the end of
     each row rather than at the beginning.  And 1 if the cell arrays
     are smaller by one along each dimension than the nodal arrays.

     If you call c_adjust as a subroutine, the input C array

                                                FROM c_adjust TO hex5_track

     unchanged and the new values returned.

     track 3 x Nrays x 2 RAYS through the 3D MESH.  RAYS(,,1) are
     points on the rays, while RAYS(,,2) are normalized ray directions.

     The c return value and the S parameter are a long and double
     array respectively, with number of elements equal to the total
     number of intersections of all the RAYS with faces of the MESH,
     plus one for any RAY which misses MESH entirely.  The values of
     c are:
       [#hits,cell1,cell2,cell3,..., #hits,cell1,cell2,cell3,..., ...]
     where each #hits is followed by the list of cell indices (assuming
     i=1, j=1, and k=1 are present but meaningless in cell arrays --
     that is, assuming zone centered arrays have the same dimensions
     as XYZ rather than one less in each direction).  Rays which miss
     the mesh entirely have #hits=1, all others have #hits>=2 since they
     must exit.  #hits<0 means a ray reentered the mesh for abs(#hits)
     more face crossings, but this currently cannot happen.  The values
     of S correspond to c:

                                               FROM hex5_track TO hex_mesh2

       [s0,s1,s2,s3,..., s0,s1,s2,s3,..., ...]
     which are the distances along the ray measured from RAYS(,,1) in
     the direction of RAYS(,,2) where the ray pierces a cell face.  For
     rays which miss the mesh, the value of s0 is a diagnostic telling
     why they missed (see compiled code).

     Function hex5_track uses the 5-tet decomposition for hexes,
     which is not unique when the quad faces are non-planar.  You may
     be able to get an idea of this effect by setting hex_triang the
     opposite way and redoing the trace.

     Functions hex24f_track and hex24b_track use the face and body
     centered 24-tet decompositions for hexes.  These are unique;
     however, hex_triang may in rare cases change the trace slightly,
     since the entry search algorithm still involves triangulating
     the surface quads.

     read a 3D mesh object from the hydra PDB/Silo file F.

     Note that the boundary arrays are adjusted to the hex convention
     that cells with i=1, j=1, k=1 are missing, rather than the hydra
     convention that i=imax, j=jmax, k=kmax are missing.

     In the first form, the ray entry search will start on the
     first open boundary face in the mesh.  If the actual problem
     boundary is not convex, you need to identify a surface of
     constant i, j, or k in the problem which is convex, and which
     all the rays you intend to trace intersect.
     UBLK is the user block number (starting from 0),
     I0, J0, K0 are the (1-origin) logical coordinates of a
       hydra *cell*.  Note that unlike hex cells, the hydra
       cell bounded by nodes (1,1,1) and (2,2,2) is numbered (1,1,1).

                                               FROM hydra_mesh TO pic3_rays

       (Hex numbers it (2,2,2).)
     FACE is the face number on cell (I0,J0,K0) which you want a
       ray to enter.  0 means the -I face, 1 the +I face, 2 the -J
       face, 3 the +J face, 4 the -K face, and 5 the +K face.
       As you step from this cell to its neighbors, then to their
       neighbors, and so on, this face must trace out a convex
       surface for the ray entry search.  Rays not intersecting
       this surface will not enter the problem; the ray trace
       will begin at this surface, not at -infinity.

     If FACE==-1 or is omitted (as in the third form), then the
     given points on the rays are assumed to lie inside the mesh,
     and a pseudo ray from the centroid of cell (I0, J0, K0) will be
     tracked to the given point on each ray; the ray will be launched
     into the cell containing that point.

     returning nlist as
       [#hits, #hits, ...]

     In this form, any negative #hits are combined with the preceding
     positive values, and #hits=1 (indicating a miss) appear as #hits=0
     in nlist.  Hence, nlist always has exactly Nrays elements.

     If RAYS is supplied, it is used to force the dimensions of the
     returned nlist to match the dimensions of RAYS (the value of RAYS
     is never used).  The RAYS argument need not have the trailing 2
     dimension, so if you specified RAYS as [P,Q] if the call to
     hex5_track, you can use just P or Q as the RAYS argument to
     track_reduce.

     If SLIMITS is supplied, it should be [smin,smax] or [smin,smax]-
     by-dimsof(nlist) in order to reject input S values outside the
     specified limits.  The C list will be culled appropriately, and
     the first and last returned ds values adjusted.

     With a non-zero flip= keyword, the order of the elements of
     C and S within each group of #hits is reversed, so that a
     subsequent track_solve will track the ray backwards.  If you
     use this, both the ray direction input to the tracking routine
     and any SLIMITS argument here should refer to the reverse of
     the ray you intend to track.

/* DOCUMENT result= track_solve(nlist, c, s, akap, ekap, last)

     integrates a transport equation for NLIST, C, and S returned
     by track_reduce (and optionally c_adjust).  The RAYS argument
     is used only to set the dimensions of the result.  AKAP and
     EKAP are mesh-sized arrays of opacity and emissivity, respectively.
     They may have an additional group dimension, as well.  The
     units of AKAP are 1/length (where length is the unit of S),
     while EKAP is (spectral) power per unit area (length^2), where
     the power is what ever units you want the result in.  The

                                            FROM track_solve TO track_solve

     emission per unit volume of material is EKAP*AKAP; an optically
     thick block of material emits EKAP per unit surface.

     The NLIST is a list of n values, so that many transport integrals
     can be performed simultaneously; sum(NLIST) = numberof(AKAP) =
     numberof(EKAP).  The result is 2-by-dimsof(NLIST), where the
     first element of the first index is the transmission fraction
     through the entire ray path, and the second element of the
     result is the self-emission along the ray, which has the same
     units as EKAP.

     If EKAP is nil, result is dimsof(NLIST) -- exactly the same as
     the transparency (1st element of result) when both EKAP and AKAP
     are specified.

     If AKAP is nil, result is dimsof(NLIST).  In this case, EKAP
     must have units of emission per unit volume instead of per unit
     area; the result will be the sum of EKAP*S along each ray.

     AKAP and EKAP may by 2D to do multigroup integrations
     simultaneously.  By default, the group dimension is first, but
     if LAST is non-nil and non-zero, the group dimension is last.
     In either case, the result will be ngroup-by-2-by-dimsof(NLIST).

     To use in conjuction with hex5_track, one might do this:

        c= hex5_track(mesh, rays, s);
        nlist= track_reduce(c, s, rays);
        c_adjust, c, mesh;  // if necessary
        result= track_solve(nlist, c, s, akap, ekap);
