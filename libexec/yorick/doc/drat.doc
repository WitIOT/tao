     are optional opacity multipliers used by the streak, snap, and

     to 1.0.

     Since opac and source are mesh-by-ngroup (where mesh is usually
     kmax-by-lmax), DRAT_EMULT, DRAT_AMULT, DRAT_OMULT can
     be scalars, mesh arrays, 1-by-1-by-ngroup arrays, or
     kmax-by-lmax-by-ngroup arrays.  If DRAT_GLIST is non-nil, ngroup
     should be numberof(DRAT_GLIST), not the total number of groups.

         or drat_backlight= <such a function>
         or drat_backlight= <array (time-independent backlighter)>
     supplies a backlighter for the snap function.

     Given ngroup-by-nrays transparency fraction transp and self-emission
     selfem (in specific intensity units), snap applies the backlighter
     using:
        result= backlighter*transp + selfem;
     where backlighter is drat_backlight(time), if drat_backlight is
     a function, or drat_backlight itself, if drat_backlight is an
     array.

     Note that the result (or value) of backlighter_func must be
     conformable with transp and selfem.  Most commonly, drat_backlight
     will be a vector of length ngroup -- a Planckian backlighter at
     temperature Tr would be
        drat_backlight= B_nu(gav, Tr);
     -- but that a scalar, 1-by-nrays, or ngroup-by-nrays are all
     possible.

     Note also that if drat_backlight is a function, the gb and gav
     arrays read from the history file are available as external
     variables.

         or drat_channel= <such a function>
         or drat_channel= <array (time-independent channel response)>
     supplies a channel response for the snap function.

     Use the drat_glist option to select a subset of the groups;
     drat_channel can be used in addition to drat_glist.

     Given ngroup-by-nrays specific intensity, snap applies the
     channel response using:
        result= drat_channel(..,+)*specific_intensity(+,..);
     if drat_channel is an array, or
        result= drat_channel(specific_intensity, time);
     if drat_channel is a function.

     Note that if drat_channel is an array, its final dimension must
     be of length ngroup.  A multidimensional drat_channel represents
     more than one channel response function.  Most drat_channel
     arrays will be proportional to the bin widths gb(dif).  The
     correct way to interpolate a filter function transmission
     fraction known at photon enrgies efa is:
        drat_channel= integ(ffa, efa, f.gb)(dif)

     If you have more than one channel, the first dimension of
     drat_channel should be the channel number.

     The best way to generate a filter response function is to
     use Yorick's cold opacity library.  To do this:
        #include "coldopac/xray.i"
     This will define the functions cold_opacity and cold_reflect,
     which you can use to build up channel response functions from
     filter materials and thicknesses and mirror compositions.

     Note also that if drat_channel is a function, the gb and gav
     arrays read from the history file are available as external
     variables.

/* DOCUMENT func drat_gate(times) { extern gb, gav;  ... }

     supplies a gate (to make gated images) for the snap function.

     For a simple gate, the drat_start and drat_stop options will
     be more efficient than drat_gate.

     The input to drat_gate is the list of dump times; the output
     should be the "effective dt" for each of these dumps.  This is
     the product of the actual time interval and the gate transparency;
     the sum of the return vector is the gate time.  See the default_gate
     and gaussian_gate functions for examples.

     Note that the gb and gav arrays read from the history file are
     available as external variables, in case the gate transparency is
     frequency dependent.

     should use numberof(DRAT_GLIST) or gav(DRAT_GLIST) instead.  The
     "gb" group boundary array is not well-defined in this case, since
     the group boundaries need not be contiguous.  The best strategy is
     to save drat_glist and the original gb array.

     DRAT_GLIST must be a 1-D, 1-origin index list.  (1-origin even if
     gav and gb are not 1-origin, since use_origins(0) will be in effect
     when DRAT_GLIST is used.)  The streak function will be most efficient

     the opacities come from a source other than the FILE, e.g.- a second

     groups is debilitatingly large, even though the number of rays times

        [[k1,l1], [k2,l2]]
     or an array of elements of that form, where either k1==k2 or
     l1==l2.  (Where k is the first index of rt or zt and l is the second.)

     DRAT_NOMILNE must always be a 1-origin index list into the (rt,zt)
     mesh, independent of the index origins of rt and/or zt.

     ekap is a mesh-by-ngroup array of source functions, in (arbitrary)
          specific intensity units
     The akap and ekap arrays must be zone centered; the first row and
     column of akap and ekap will be ignored.

     The remaining variables are all optional -- set the drat_.. variable
     to [] to ignore them completely.  Otherwise, they will be ignored if
     they are not present in the history file, and used as follows
     otherwise:
     ireg is a mesh-size region number array (zone centered as akap and
          ekap).  Zones where ireg==0 do not exist.
     isymz is non-zero if the problem has reflection symmetry about z=0,
          zero otherwise.  The drat_symmetry option overrides this value.
     khold and lhold are mesh indices specifying "hold lines" --
          khold is an index into the first dimension of (rt,zt), and
          lhold is an index into the second dimension of (rt,zt).

     The first dimension of RAYS may be length 3, 5, or 6 to represent

     respectively.  The remaining dimensions of RAYS, if any, will be
     called "nrays" below.

     The SLIMITS parameter, if present, is the value of the s-coordinate
     -- position along the ray -- at which to start and stop the
     integration of the transport equation.  SLIMITS may be nil, a 1-D
     array of length 2, or a 2-by-nrays array.  Each component of SLIMITS
     is [s_start, s_stop]; if s_stop<s_start, the integration will run
     from minus infinity to plus infinity, which is the default.  The
     s-coordinate is measured from the reference point if RAYS is given
     in "best" or internal format, or from the point of closest approach
     to the origin r=z=0 if RAYS is given in TDG/DIRT format.

     The variables rt, zt, akap, and ekap must be present in the
     history file F, and represent, respectively, cylindrical coordinate,
     axial coordinate, absorption opacity, and source function.  The mesh
     (rt,zt) is a kmax-by-lmax array.  The opacity akap must be in units

     of inverse length (e.g.- 1/rt or 1/zt); its dimensions should be
     kmax-by-lmax-by-ngroup.  The source function ekap must be in units
     of specific intensity -- power per unit area per unit solid angle
     per unit spectrum, or "B nu units"; ekap must have the same dimensions
     as akap.  (The akap and ekap arrays may be padded so that they are
     actually (longer than kmax*lmax)-by-ngroup to handle outdated storage
     formats.)  The names "rt", "zt", "akap", and "ekap" may be changed
     by setting the drat_rt, drat_zt, drat_akap, and drat_ekap options.

     The result has dimension ngroup-by-nrays, where nrays is
     related to the dimensions of RAYS as above, and NGROUP is
     the number of groups in akap and ekap.

     Many external variables modify the behavior of streak.  Each of
     these options is separately documented.  The drat_glist option
     can be used to select a subset of ngroup, which can obviously
     reduce the processing time.  The drat_backlight and drat_gate
     options allow you to specify backlighter and gating functions,
     respectively.

     If you set any options, be careful.  The reset_options functions

     is [s_start, s_stop]; if s_stop<s_start, the integration will run
     from minus infinity to plus infinity, which is the default.  The
     s-coordinate is measured from the reference point if RAYS is given
     in "best" or internal format, or from the point of closest approach
     to the origin r=z=0 if RAYS is given in TDG/DIRT format.

     The variables rt, zt, akap, and ekap must be present in the

     axial coordinate, absorption opacity, and source function.  The mesh
     (rt,zt) is a kmax-by-lmax array.  The opacity akap must be in units
     of inverse length (e.g.- 1/rt or 1/zt); its dimensions should be
     kmax-by-lmax-by-ngroup.  The source function ekap must be in units
     of specific intensity -- power per unit area per unit solid angle
     per unit spectrum, or "B nu units"; ekap must have the same dimensions
     as akap.  (The akap and ekap arrays may be padded so that they are

     The ireg array, if present in F, is also used.

     The result has dimension ngroup-by-2-by-nrays-by-ntimes, where
     ntimes is the number of history records in the file F, nrays is
     related to the dimensions of RAYS as above, and NGROUP is
     the number of groups in akap and ekap.  The first component of
     the length-2 second dimension is the transparency (between 0 and 1),
     and the second component is the self-emission (which has the same
     units as ekap, specific intensity).

     Many external variables modify the behavior of streak.  Each of
     these options is separately documented.  The drat_glist option
     can be used to select a subset of ngroup, which can obviously
     reduce the processing time.  The drat_compress option can be used
     to reduce the size of the result, so that the amount of data
     saved at each time is less than ngroup-by-2-by-nrays.

     If you set any options, be careful.  The reset_options functions
     clears all options back to their default values;
   OPTIONS: drat_rt, drat_zt, drat_ireg, drat_akap, drat_ekap,
            drat_ireg, drat_isymz, drat_khold, drat_lhold,
            drat_amult, drat_emult, drat_omult, drat_ireg_adj,
            drat_start, drat_stop, drat_symmetry, drat_glist,
            drat_linear, drat_nomilne,
            drat_integrate, drat_compress, drat_quiet

     The include file multi.i defines an extension to the streak function
     for allowing the opacities and emissivities to be read from several
     history files.  Include multi.i, then get help on multi_streak.

     is the same as the streak function, except that the results of
     the transport calculation are placed into a PDB file called
     OUTNAME, instead of being accumulated in memory.  All of the
     options for the streak function are available, except for
     drat_compress (which is set to streak_saver).

     If the first argument is OUTFILE, a file variable instead of a
     file name, then that file is used for output.  You can create
     OUTFILE and add static variables to it with save (but do NOT call
     add_record) which streak_save otherwise wouldn't know about.

     The output file has history records at the same times as the
     input file.  Each record contains "time" (a double scalar),
     and the two arrays "transp", the transparency (between 0 and 1),
     and "selfem", the self emission (which has the same units as
     ekap in the file F).  The dimensions of transp and selfem
     are ngroup-by-2-by-nrays (where nrays represents zero or more
     dimensions, copied from the RAYS input array).  The RAYS and
     SLIMITS inputs are placed into the output file as non-record
     variables, and any variables in the drat_static option are
     copied form F to the output file.  The gb and gav variables
     are copied from F into the output file as well.  If the drat_glist
     option is present, that is stored in the output file also.

   OPTIONS: all options available for streak except drat_compress,
            drat_gb, drat_gav, drat_static
